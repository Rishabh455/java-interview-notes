Java Interface
An Interface in Java is an abstract type that defines a set of methods a class must implement.

An interface acts as a contract that specifies what a class should do, but not how it should do it. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. We define interfaces for capabilities (e.g., Comparable, Serializable, Drawable).
